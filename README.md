# Atmega324p_Timer_Projects

Timers operate in the background; while the microcontroller runs your code, the timers are counting away. The ATmega324P has three timers: TIMER0, TIMER1, and TIMER2 with their own counter registers. TIMER0 and TIMER2 are 8-bit counters with a maximum value of 255. TIMER1 is a 16-bit counter and has a maximum value of 65,535. In this repository, I will give some examples showing how to use timers with an Atmega324p microcontroller.
