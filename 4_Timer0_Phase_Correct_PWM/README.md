# Project: Phase Correct PWM Generation Using Timer/Counter0

## The aim
The aim of this project is to show how to control LED brightness using Phase Correct PWM generated by the Timer/Counter0 in the ATmega324p microcontroller.

## Simulation of the Phase Correct PWM signal using Proteus Simulation Software
